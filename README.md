# TRINCI Assemblyscript Smart Contract SDK

Official Trinci 2 smart contract SDK library for assemblyscript

## Description

This library will allow you to write your own TRINCI smart contract in assemblyscript and publish it to the network

## Usage

- Create a new directory to host your project
- Install SDK: `npm install @affidaty/trinci-sdk-as`
- Launch the initialization script inside sdk package: `./node_modules/@affidaty/trinci-sdk-as/init.sh`
- Install all dependencies: `npm install`
- At this point you can explore a sample `data storage` smart contract(starting from `assembly/index.ts`). Sample smart contract contains all things you need to succesfully create your own basic smart contract.
- Compile: `npm run asbuild`. Sample smart contract is compilable right out of the box.
