## [2.4.1] - 2022-10-31

### Fixed
- fixed hf_s_call() host functions.

## [2.4.0] - 2022-10-31

### Added

- SDK now works with assemblyscript v0.20.0 to v0.21.7
- `serializeInternalType<>()` and `deserializeInternalType<>()` functions to easily (de)serialize internal assemblyscript types (`bool`, `u8`, `i8`, `u16`, `i16`, `u32`, `i32`, `u64`, `i64`, `f32`, `f64`, `string`, `ArrayBuffer`) and arrays of those types.
- added possibility to test compiled smart contracts(.wasm) directly with jest without need to set up a full TRINCI node.
- added a sample jest test for sample smart contract. Try it with `npm run test` after compiling example smart contract with `npm run asbuild`.
- account class for better account data management.
- methods for node db exploration.
- new Host functions supported: hf_s_call, hf_emit, is_callable. hf_verify, hf_get_block_time, hf_remove_asset
- BulkTX simulation
- js script for smart contract publication in blockchain ("utils" directory). Run it with "--help" to get usage help.
- added EventEmitter no node simulator, which fires events emitted by smart contracts(node.EventEmitter.on('txEvent', ()=>{}))
- added SocketRelay to simulate node socket connection. Launch it before test and do ```node.connectToSocket('<relayInterface>', <relayPort>);``` in your jest test to relay all emitted events as if you were connected to a real TRINCI node. Then you'll be able to connect with your software to that relay as if it was a real TRINCI node with socket connection. Launch it with "utils/socketRelay.js --help" to get help.
